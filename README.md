# Advent of Code

Learning to use Scheme better by doing Advent of Code, on absolutely no schedule at all.

![We'll get there when we get there!](when-we-get-there.gif)

Where at all possible, I use only standard Scheme functions from R‚ÅµRS. (Even better if I can run it using my own implementation!) Otherwise, I'm using DrRacket, so I can fall back to their library from PLT Pretty Big language or (if necessary) Racket. At the very least, I'm trying to use absolutely no Racket-specific syntax.
